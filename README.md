# PSTAT231-Project
In recent years, the United States has seen a boom in the sports betting market.  Thanks to the popularity of fantasy sports, Americans find themselves engrossed in the world of sports. Competitors in traditional fantasy leagues follow their players for the whole season. Fans of the season-long format have welcomed the newer daily fantasy format. With daily fantasy, a competitor selects a team and they win if the team outperforms most of the others. Competitors have the option to swap underperforming players the following week with no consequences. 

Teams are scored on their real-life performance. A teamâ€™s players earn points based on their actual game statistics. Exceptional performance in particular statistics can be worth more. Competitors focus on players which benefit this goal, thus the prediction of future actions of an athlete is of interest in fantasy sports. 

Specifically we want to predict whether or not Kobe Bryant successfully makes his shot. For his entire 20-year NBA career Kobe Bryant played on the Los Angeles Lakers. From 1996 to 2016 Bryant attempted over 30,000 field goals. We are investigating which variables are most relevant to making two- and three-pointers, then building a model to predict the success or failure for a test data set of 5,000 records based on these findings. We will seek trends in the data and discuss whether or not our findings coincide with conventional wisdom.
